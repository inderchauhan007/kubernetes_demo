A DaemonSet is a watch loop object like a Deployment which we have been working with in the rest of the labs. The DaemonSet
ensures that when a node is added to a cluster a pods will be created on that node.
A Deployment would only ensure a particular number of pods are created in general, several could be on a single node. Using a 
DaemonSet can be helpful to ensure applications are on each node, helpful for things like metrics and logging especially in
large clusters where hardware my be swapped out often. Should a node be be removed from a cluster the DaemonSet would ensure 
the Pods are garbage collected before removal. Starting with Kubernetes v1.12 the scheduler handles DaemonSet deployment which
means we can now configure certain nodes to not have a particular DaemonSet pods.

1. We begin by creating a yaml file. In this case the kind would be set to DaemonSet. For ease of use we will copy the
previously created replicasetdefination.yaml  file and make a couple edits. Remove the Replicas: 2 line.

Perform Below Action :
======================

A) Copy exisitng replicaset defination to a new file with name deamonsetdefination.yaml

inders-MacBook-Pro:poddemo chauhai1$ cp -p replicasetdefination.yaml  deamonsetdefination.yaml

B) Modify Below contents 

....
2 kind: DaemonSet
3 ....
4 name: ds-one
5 ....
6 replicas: 2 #<<<----Remove this line
7 ....
8 system: DaemonSetOne
9 ....

C) File will look like below - post modification 

====
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
 name: ds-one
spec:
 template:
  metadata:
   labels:
     system: DeamonSetOne
  spec:
   containers:
   - name: grafana
     image: grafana/grafana:6.0.2
     ports:
     - containerPort: 80

======

D) Apply the defination file . :

inders-MacBook-Pro:poddemo chauhai1$ kubectl create -f deamonsetdefination.yaml 

E) Check the Status :

inders-MacBook-Pro:poddemo chauhai1$ kubectl get ds
NAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR   AGE
ds-one    1         1         1         1            1           <none>          5s
inders-MacBook-Pro:poddemo chauhai1$ 

F)  Check the Pods created by DeamonSet

inders-MacBook-Pro:poddemo chauhai1$ kubectl get all
NAME                                    READY     STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
pod/ds-one-5fk5s                        1/1       Running            0          <invalid>

NAME                    DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR   AGE
daemonset.apps/ds-one   1         1         1         1            1           <none>          <invalid>
